## LLSRFS: Unsupervised Feature Selection by Learning Exponential Weights
This repository provides a python implementation of LLSRFS as described in the paper ["Unsupervised Feature Selection by Learning Exponential Weights"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320323008804).

## Datasets
All data sets can be obtained from the UCI machine learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) or scikit-feature selection repository (https://jundongl.github.io/scikit-feature/datasets.html).

## Environment Settings
Install the following packages:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- pandas

## Running the code
You can run the following demo function directly
```sh
demo.py
```
or run the following parameter search function
```sh
para_search.py
```
